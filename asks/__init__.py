'''
Alright, you're probably having a heart attack looking at this right now.
Just breathe, and it will be ok, I promise!

asks was initially created just to support curio, until trio came along
with its similar design and approach to async in python. Why not support both?

So, the idea here is that asks, after import, must be told explicitly which
event loop to use. Upon first import, asks has _AsyncLib which is an empty
shell. Upon asks' initialisation the instance of _AsyncLib asks uses is
populated either with functions and classes directly from the chosen async lib,
or with wrappers around those functions and classes such that they share the
same api to the extent asks requires.

This results in a meeting point between the two libraries which asks can use
arbitrarily. (You can even run a trio event loop, and then run the same
functions with curio! Not recommended, but hey. It's fun.)

For the sake of simplicity, where possible, the methods of _AsyncLib use the
curio name. For example, TaskTimeout from curio rather than
TooSlowError from trio. This is not indicative of any preference to the
libraries themselves, it just required fewer changes to asks' internals to
implement.
