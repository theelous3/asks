What is asks?
_____________

asks is an async http lib that can best be described as an effort to bring the same level of usable abstraction that requests offers synchronous python, to asynchronous python programming. Ideal for api interactions, webscraping etc.

asks is compatible with `curio` and `trio`.

It is important to note that the code examples in this documentation are to showcase asks, and not curio or trio. In real code, it would be benificial to use things like taskgroups/nurserys and other neat tools to manage your requests. Here's a link to curio and trio's docs for refrence:

http://curio.rtfd.io/

http://trio.rtfd.io


Installation:
_____________

asks requires `Python 3.6 <www.python.org>`_ .

The easiest way to install asks is to pip it::

    pip install asks

Internally asks uses the excellent `h11 <https://github.com/njsmith/h11>`_. It will be installed automatically.

asks was built for use with `curio <https://github.com/dabeaz/curio>`_ and `trio <https://github.com/python-trio/trio>`_

Importing asks
______________

You must specify what event loop asks should use after importing asks, and at some point before you run any code that uses asks. The event loop is set with ``asks.init()``. The following code will run the ``example`` coroutine once with curio and once with trio: ::

    import asks
    import curio
    import trio

    async def example():
        r = asks.get('https://example.org')

    asks.init('curio')
    curio.run(example)

    asks.init('trio')
    trio.run(example)

If you forget to initialise asks with an eventloop you'll get a ``RuntimeError``.


A quick note on the examples in these docs
__________________________________________

asks began by only supporting curio, and the code examples use curio throughout. At any point in the examples you could switch say, ``async with curio.TaskGroup`` to ``async with trio.open_nursery``, and everything would be the same bar curio/trio's api differences. Internally, asks has no bias for either library. Both are beautiful creatures.

A little example:
_________________

Here's how to grab a single request and print it's content::

    # single_get.py
    import asks
    import curio
    asks.init('curio')

    async def grabber(url):
        r = await asks.get(url)
        print(r.content)

    curio.run(grabber('https://example.com'))

    # Results in:
    # b'<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Example Domain</title>\n\n

Making one request in an async program is a little weird, but not without its use. This sort of basic ``asks.get()`` would slot in quite nicely in a greater program that makes some calls here and there.


A bigger little example:
________________________

Here's an example of making 1000 calls to an api and storing the results in a list. We'll use the ``Session`` class here to take advantage of connection pooling.::

    # many_get.py
    # make a whole pile of api calls and store
    # their response objects in a list.
    # Using the homogeneous-session.

    import asks
    import curio
    asks.init('curio')

    path_list = ['a', 'list', 'of', '1000', 'paths']

    retrieved_responses = []

    s = asks.Session('https://some-web-service.com',
                      connections=20)

    async def grabber(a_path):
        r = await s.get(path=a_path)
        retrieved_responses.append(r)

    async def main(path_list):
        for path in path_list:
            curio.spawn(grabber(path))

    curio.run(main(path_list))

Now we're talkin'.

A thousand requests running async at the drop of a hat, using clean burning connection pooling to play nicely with the target server.


Why asks?
_________

If you like async, but don't like the spaghetti-docs furture-laden many-looped asyncio lib, you'll probably love curio and trio. If you wish you could marry them with requests, you'll probably love asks.

Nice libs like aiohttp suffer the side effect of uglyness due to being specifically for asyncio. Inspired by requests and the fancy new-age async libs, I wanted to take that lovely ultra abstraction and apply it to an async http lib to eleviate some of the pain in dealing with async http.


Features
________

asks packs most if not all of the features requests does. The usual ``.json()`` ing of responses and such. You can take a more in depth look `here <https://asks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview-of-funcs-and-args.html>`_.

Because asks is aimed at crunching large piles of requests its Session has some features you may not be aware of. Sessions in asks are the main focus. More detail can be found `here <https://asks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/a-look-at-sessions.html>`_

The Future
__________
Now that's trio support has been implemented, it's housecleaning time. asks has some cobwebs that need clearing, and refactoring those in to a nice silk dress is the current focus.
